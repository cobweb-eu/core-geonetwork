<h1>About the COBWEB Dyfi Biosphere Reserve Portal</h1>
<p><b>What is the COBWEB Dyfi Biosphere Reserve Portal?</b><br/>
The COBWEB Dyfi Biosphere Reserve Portal is a gateway for people like you (citizens) to discover, learn about, take part in, and even initiate your own environmental surveys, collecting important scientific data using your mobile devices (smartphones or tablets).
The data you collect are invaluable pieces of information, that collectively provide researchers and policy makers with the evidence they need to support their research and decisions.
</p><p><b>How does it work?</b><br/>
The COBWEB Portal enables people to take advantage of what is known as crowdsourcing; taking a large task and distributing it to an undefined crowd of people to complete.
"Crowdsourcing" is an umbrella term that is often used to describe different ways in which a crowd is used to perform tasks, and/or collect information (data). In the case of the COBWEB Portal, since the data collected are of a scientific nature, this form of crowdsourcing is often called "citizen science" (the involvement of volunteers in science). Other terms include participatory science, volunteered geographic information and crowdsourced science.
Citizen science is becoming an ever more popular method of performing scientific research because large amounts of data can be collected quickly. Advances in mobile technologies make citizen science increasingly viable as a research tool. However, many people often view the data collected by the crowd as unreliable. This is why the COBWEB Portal is so important.
</p><p><b>What makes the COBWEB Portal different from other crowdsourcing platforms and existing citizen science apps?</b><br/>
Through using the COBWEB Portal, you will unknowingly be using open technologies and standards to make sure that the data you collect are reliable. Data are recorded in such a way that they can be compared to existing, accurate data and re-used by other projects.
It starts with designing a survey that is "fit-for-purpose", in other words, are you asking the right questions, in the right way, to get the data you need? Read more about designing a survey here.
Data collected are then stringently checked through the COBWEB Quality Assurance process. This procedure cleans the data, to remove incorrect observations, and assigns a quality rating to the individual observations and the dataset as a whole. This tells us how reliable the data are.
</p><p><b>Where did the COBWEB Dyfi Biosphere Reserve Portal come from?</b><br/>
The COBWEB Dyfi Biosphere Reserve Portal has been developed by the <a href="http://cobwebproject.eu">COBWEB Project</a>. The COBWEB Project is a collaborative European project that seeks to empower citizens to collect and contribute data for use in policy formation and governance.
</p><p>
COBWEB has received funding from the European Unions Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement No 308513.
